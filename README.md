# üî¨ MotifFinder: A Basic DNA Motif Search Tool in C

MotifFinder is a command-line C program that allows users to analyze DNA sequences and identify common motifs with allowed mismatches. It implements foundational algorithms using dynamic memory allocation, string handling, and low-level array operations.

This tool is ideal for students or researchers learning bioinformatics concepts such as Hamming distance, substring generation, and motif comparison in DNA sequences.

## üìå Features

- User input validation for:
  - Number of DNA sequences (`n`)
  - Length of sequences (`l`)
  - Motif length (`m`)
  - Allowed mismatches (`h`)
- Dynamic generation of all possible motif candidates (e.g., 4^m)
- Substring extraction from DNA sequences
- Hamming distance-based motif matching with tolerance for mismatches
- Displays:
  - All candidate motifs
  - All valid substrings per sequence
  - Matching motifs for each sequence
  - Motifs common to all DNA sequences
- Defensive programming with memory management and error handling

üßπ Memory Management
All dynamic allocations are properly freed to prevent memory leaks.
The code has been tested with Valgrind for clean execution.
